this is mini project 1
inspired by Sol's artwork with a lot of linework
Grayscale, lines and background. With a splash of color. Intersecting lines in diagonals from two directions, as well as vertically and horizontally. A blue and pink that are both closer to purple are the only colors used, contrasting with the varying shades of gray.
